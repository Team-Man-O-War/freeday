At the end of the off-ramp proceed south toward the ocean. Park in the lot for <i>Juan Bautist de Anza Park</i> located on the northwest corner of Lost Hills and Las Virgenes Roads. Park along the street if the lot is full.</p> <p><b>Ride Description:</b></p> <p><b>Level:</b> Beginner to Intermediate</p> <p><b>Ride Duration:</b> About 2 hours moving time / Total ride time approximately 3.5 hours with breaks</p> <p><b>Miles/Roundtrip: </b>11.2 miles</p> <p><b>Bathrooms at Trail:</b> Yes - There are facilities at the beginning of the ride located on the right side of the recreation center building.  Also there are porta-potty restrooms located  within the park along the trail in a couple of places.</p> <p>This ride starts from the <i>Juan Batista de Anza </i>park and continues into a single track over the <i>Grasslands</i> trail. We then cross over <i>Mulholland</i> road (watch out for cars/traffic) and continue into<i> Malibu Creek State Park</i> along the single track and onto a larger fire road. We have a few steep down hill spots and then a nice climb and down again to a rocky section that will require most to walk through. Then we are at the M*A*S*H TV Show Site. For the more adventurous we will continue further to the “Bull Dog” and do a half way up loop back to the M*A*S*H site, but this is some serious climbing for Intermediate tech and strong cardio riders. Finally we will backtrack and return to <i>Juan Batista de Anza </i>park.</p> <p>This <b><i>Strava</i></b> link shows the route pretty well. Click the link to show you the area, the mileage, and the elevation gain.  It's about 2 hours for folks going to the Foundation.

As always, all riders should be aware that mountain biking can be extremely physically demanding. Each rider should be conscious of their own limitations. It is encouraged to walk any sections of the trail you are not comfortable riding. Don’t be surprised if you are not able to keep up with the group your first time out. Don’t get discouraged. It will take some newcomers a few rides before they can build up their leg strength, cardio and overall technique before feeling at home on a mountain bike trail. be encouraged– We will have volunteers that will help you along the way and stay with you at your pace. </i></p> <p><b><i>– See more Newcomer Recommendations at the bottom of this post.</i></b></p> <p><i><b>What to Bring: </b></i></p> <p><i>• Helmet (mandatory) </i></p> <p>• Water (in bike cage and/or in your back pack)</p> <p>• Snacks for energy </p> <p>• Extra bike tube and patch kit </p> <p>• Bike Pump</p> <p>• Apparel appropriate for trail riding</p> <p>• Protective eye ware </p> <p>• Sun screen lotion</p> <p>• Multi-tools, etc. for mechanical issues</p> <p>• 2-way radio if you have one (will select channel before ride)</p> <p><b>– Please post comments or contact the ride hosts if you have any other questions or concerns about this ride. </b></p> <p><b>Newcomer Recommendations (cont.):</b></p> <p>• Continue training throughout the week in order to build up strength and riding skills.</p> <p>• Attend the<i> CORBA</i> (The Concerned Off-Road Bicyclists Association) Free Mountain Bike Skills Clinics, held the 1st Saturday of each month; </p> <p><a href=\"http://www.corbamtb.com/programs/skills.shtml\"><a href=\"http://www.corbamtb.com/programs/skills.shtml\" class=\"linkified\">http://www.corbamtb.com/programs/skills.shtml</a></a></p> <p>\"Although the Shepherd Church MTB Club in not affiliated with <i>CORBA</i> some or our riders have benefited immensely from the free training they provide.
